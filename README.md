Played this game called [Stepford County Railway](https://www.roblox.com/games/696347899/V2-1-Stepford-County-Railway) (SCR for short) and I js wanted a way to make journeys for the routes I have so I don't have to go back to the menu every time I wanna switch routes. I asked ChatGPT to help me with making those journeys. The rules (well the gist of it since I had to add on more for the ai to understand, but its wtv) I gave was to minimize the amount of journeys for the routes I gave and for the routes to only be used once. But in the end they sucked once the routes I gave them became too big. So yea, I literally made this code in spite of ChatGPT. 

**THIS CODE NOW SUPPORTS EVERY OPERATOR!!!**

Note: Also the code has around a 3-7% error rate, but it's not that significant. Like for example, sometimes it might give you 3 journeys instead of 2, but you can either leave it as that or figure out a way to make it a journey less.
