Played this game called [Stepford County Railway](https://www.roblox.com/games/696347899/V2-1-Stepford-County-Railway) (SCR for short) and I js wanted a way to make journeys for the routes I have. ChatGPT helped me with making those journeys, but in the end they sucked once the routes I gave them became too big. So yea, I literally made this code in spite of ChatGPT.

**FOR NOW THIS ONLY WORKS FOR EXPRESS ROUTES!!!**
