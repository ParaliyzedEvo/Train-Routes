Played this game called [Stepford County Railway](https://www.roblox.com/games/696347899/V2-1-Stepford-County-Railway) (SCR for short) and I js wanted a way to make journeys for the routes I have. ChatGPT helped me with making those journeys, but in the end they sucked once the routes I gave them became too big. So yea, I literally made this code in spite of ChatGPT. 


**FOR NOW THIS ONLY WORKS FOR EXPRESS AND CONNECT ROUTES!!!** (but Airlink and Waterline will be supported once I get enough points lol)

Note: Also the code has around a 3-5% error rate, but it's not that significant. Like for example, it might give you 3 journeys instead of 2, but you can either leave it as that or figure out a way to make it a journey less.
